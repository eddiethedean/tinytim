### Added

#### Development Infrastructure

  - Standard pre-commit hooks (yaml checking, trailing whitespace, etc.)
  - Mypy type checking
- Added `.editorconfig` for consistent code style across editors
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with comprehensive contribution guidelines

  - All code examples tested and outputs verified
  - Fixed incorrect function imports and API usage
  - Comprehensive quick start guide with 10+ sections
  - Added "More Examples" section with advanced features
  - Clear installation and development setup instructions
  - All links now point to GitHub repository
  - Additional badges for Python version and license
- Added detailed sections for:
  - Basic data operations (head, tail, shape, etc.)
  - Working with rows and columns
  - Filtering and selection (with correct function names)
  - Handling missing values (dropna, fillna, isna)
  - Grouping and aggregation (groupby, sum_groups)
  - Joining data (inner_join, left_join)
  - Editing data (edit_row_items, drop_row, drop_column)
  - Inserting data (insert_row, insert_rows)
  - Advanced filtering (filter_by_column_eq, filter_by_column_gt, sample)
  - Copying data (copy_table, deepcopy_table)
  - Development setup and testing

#### Configuration
- Added comprehensive tool configuration in `pyproject.toml`:
  - pytest configuration with coverage settings
  - mypy strict type checking configuration
  - ruff linting and formatting rules
  - coverage.py settings
- Updated `.gitignore` with:
  - Modern tool cache directories (ruff, pytest, pyright)
  - Better organization with comments
  - IDE-specific entries

### Development Notes

This release focuses on modernizing the development infrastructure while maintaining:
- **Zero runtime dependencies** (hasattrs>=0.0.2 remains the only dependency)
- **Python 3.8+ support** (despite Python 3.8 reaching EOL in October 2024)
- **Pure Python implementation**
- **Backward compatibility**

### Migration Guide for Contributors

If you're a contributor, please note these changes:

1. **Linting**: Replace `flake8` commands with `ruff check`
2. **Formatting**: Use `ruff format` instead of black or autopep8
3. **Pre-commit**: Install pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`
4. **Testing**: Tox now tests Python 3.8-3.12 (up from just 3.8)
5. **Development setup**: Use `pip install -e ".[dev]"` for all dev dependencies

### For Users

No breaking changes for end users. All APIs remain unchanged.
